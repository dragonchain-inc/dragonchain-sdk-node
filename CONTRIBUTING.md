# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Dragonchain SDK! User feedback is core to producing the best possible product. Please feel free to use GitHub issues to report bugs or request features. We are not currently accepting pull requests, will be soon.

We want to make sure that this SDK makes interacting with a chain as simple as possible. To that end, these guidelines are intended to provide structure to requests, improve communication, and reduce time to fix. If you have suggestions on these guidelines, please contact the maintainers.

## Issues

Please review closed issues before opening another issue. This reduces duplications and saves us time. If you also have a problem in an open issue, or a closed issue doesn't satisfyingly solve your problem, please consider commenting or reopening an issue instead of creating a new one.

If no issues already exist, please use the following format when you make a new issue:

* Quick summary of your use case
* Reproduction steps
  * be as specific as you can, and provide as much detail as possible! The more detail we have, the easier it is for us to reproduce and solve the issue.
* What you expect(ed) to happen
* What actually happened (if applicable)
* Notes, such as ways you've attempted to resolve the bug on your own, theories, or any other information you have to give

## Examples, Blog Posts,Â and Tutorials

We would love to see the community give examples of projects they've made on the Dragonchain platform, blogs about lessons learned and problems overcome, or tutorials to help others in the community get up to speed quicker. To submit example code, link to your blog, or add a tutorial to the SDK, please contact the maintainers.

## Getting Started

If you're looking to contribute to Dragonchain but don't know where to start, you can begin by looking over open issues, collaborating with others in the community, or even writing an SDK in a different language!
